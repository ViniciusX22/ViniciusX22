  aboutContent:
   `<p>My name is Vinícius and I make things for the internet, aka, I'm a web developer. I started professionally in 2020,
    which leaves me with approximately <em>{years} years</em> of experience in this field.</p>

    <p>I've worked on several challenging projects in the automation, retail and credit sectors, creating everything
    from simple report pages that consume an API to dashboards for analysis, monitoring and remote access of PLCs.
    In my projects, I mainly use Vue.js/Nuxt.js for the frontend and Node.js and Python for the backend.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I like to study technology and experiment with various technologies of all kinds,
    such as browser extensions, task automation and even games. I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge.</p>`,
