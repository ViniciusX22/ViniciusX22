   `
    <p>
      I'm Vinícius, a Software Engineer who builds things for the internet (a.k.a. web developer). 
      Since 2020, I've been crafting everything from interactive dashboards to automation tools and even occasionally games. 
      If there's a challenge, I'll dive in headfirst &#8212; especially if it involves problem-solving, optimizing performance, or making complex things simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my professional journey, I've worked with Vue.js, React, Node.js, and Python, helping businesses in sectors like automation, retail, finance and delivery. 
      Whether it's a critical frontend application or an efficient backend tool, I focus on clean code, usability, and scalability.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I'm probably experimenting with new tech, building fun side projects, or figuring out how to automate things I'm too lazy to do manually. 
      (If you haven't tried scripting away life's little inconveniences, you're missing out!)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in working together, collaborating on a project, or just chatting about tech, feel free to reach out!
